                    In his research, he focuses on empirically studying software developers and on using personal and biometric data to improve software developers' productivity. By better understanding what software developers need, what they experience, and how they operate on a daily basis, we will be able to provide better and more tailored support to developers as well as improve their productivity and the quality of the software they produce. In particular, Thomas is interested in three areas: developer productivity, biometric sensing and information needs.
                    Thopmas works with over 20 international companies, including ABB, Microsoft, and IBM. This research was featured in several media, including the New Yorker, the Wall Street Journal, and the New Scientist.

                    Quinn's research is at the intersection of human factors, static program analysis and machine learning. Specifically, he helps developers gain insight into how code changes affect program behaviour by investigating (1) what information developers need and how to present that information during code review, and (2) how program analysis tools can leverage large datasets of source code changes to automatically learn relevant information.
